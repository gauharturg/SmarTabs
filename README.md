Project relevence:
    An act of untimely taken medications can be the cause of poisoning. In order to recover faster it’s important to take the medications at the specific time, but it’s very difficult to keep track of it because of workload or problems with memory. In this regard we decided to create this project with a view to solve this problem.
The description:
    Our project serves for storage of the various types of meds, by which it becomes possible for a patient to take meds at the prescript time. Also, the cover of device is closed by lock, which makes it impossible to overdose, because the access is provided only for doctor. As necessary, the doctor or trustee can resupply in the reserves of medicaments, by opening the cover with card or code. Every patient has individual his/her non-contact key, which looks like a bracelet. No one can take the dose of the owner except for himself/herself. Moreover the bracelet informs about taking medicines.
   Used details:
o	Liquid Crystal Display –date output, information about containers in which the medicaments are in deficit;
o	Keypad- providing the access to internal part of the device;
o	Servo Motor –revitalization of disks which give the pills, the opening of the upper part, revitalization of platform under the cup;
o	Diaphragm Water Pump – providing water;
o	Peltier Element, Thermostat, Ventilator – changing and maintaining the temperature inside of the device.
The main features:
	The automated medicine regimen;
	Avoidance of overdose;
	Water delivery;
	Maintaining the temperature inside of the device;
	Notification about  the absence of pills;
	Opportunity of working with several patients.

How does it work?
On the website, each patient has his/her account with all his/her doctors attached. They fill out in the names of the diseases and a schedule of taking pills on the particular page. The input data connects to the “SmarTabs”. Following that, patient may use the direct device. 
“SmarTabs” automatically notifies about taking meds via bracelet’s vibration. The patient needs to come to the device and put the bracelet to the icon “Access to medication”. At the same time the device starts “to collect” the meds which are prescribed at the moment and finally will give the cup with pills.
Also, there is a container for water with a capacity of 1 liter. Optionally, the patient can take the pills with water. In order to get the water, the patient is required to press the button on the right side of the device.
When pills are almost gone, the device outputs the notification at the display in which there will be the information about the number of container and the name of medicament which are in deficit.
The patient is required to visit the doctor at least once a month so that it is possible for a doctor to recharge or change pills.
 In order to working with several patients there has to be the trustee (doctor, nurse etc) who keeps track of the sufficient amount of medicaments and all personal regimes. In addition, every person will have his/her own bracelet with ID number which notifies its possessor. Other work conditions of the mechanism are identical with the ones, aimed for a single person.
